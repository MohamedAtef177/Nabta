The agriculture sectors which includes crop and livestock production as 
well as fisheries face many risks, such as climate and market volatility, 
pests and diseases, an ever-increasing number of protracted crises and 
conflicts, and extreme weather events resulting in loss of nutritional 
value, over-ripen and changes at texture, appearance, and flavor, and 
this affects the quality of the agricultural crops. This leads to losses 
of more than 40 billion dollars in only Africa. Nabta project aims to develop 
an automated helpful system for agriculture that can be useful for farmers, 
farming lovers, and agricultural companies. It can perform the main agricultural 
tasks accurately by using deep learning to solve the problems faced by farmers, 
and farming lovers such as crop identification, disease recognition, ripeness 
assessment, and help with how to care about a specific plant.\\\\
Nabta helps in the early detection of the disease and yields assessment to reduce 
loss in crops. NABTA project achieved an accuracy of 99\% for plant recogination 
and an average accuracy of 99\% for diseases recogination of eight crops. Moreover, 
NABTA project achieved mean average precision (mAP) of 91\% for strawberry ripeness 
classification.
